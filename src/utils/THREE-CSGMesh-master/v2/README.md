A CSG Toy by Thrax!

What you can do:

The app starts with a few primitives.. each primitive can be either a "subtract", a "union" or an "intersection" primitive.

There is also an ordering to the primitives. Primitives operations are applied in order.

The first primitive is considered the "root" and is what defines the origin of the resulting computed mesh.

Keys:

+       - switches the selected primitives to "union"
-       - switches the selected primitives to "subtract"
|       - switches the selected primitives to "intersect"

Ctrl    - rotate mode
Alt     - scale mode
Shift   - multiple select

This is a toy built around the three-csg library I ported from the excellent:
